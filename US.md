# About our terms of service

Welcome to Stripe. We developed a payment service (the “Stripe Payments”) to make it easy for you to accept credit and debit card payments online from your customers so you can focus on your own product or service. We have also developed additional services that you can use with Stripe Payments, such as Stripe Connect (allowing you to share data and management of your account with various platforms) and Stripe Relay (allowing you to publish product information and accept orders through various channels).

We have tried to draft these Merchant Terms of Service to be readable, but should you have any questions or concerns or would simply like to better understand how we do things at Stripe, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://stripe.com/help/contact).

Below is a quick description of the sections in this Agreement, but there are important details in the whole document, so you should read it.

# The Stripe Services

We provide you with software and a service to process your online payments; we will respect and protect your privacy, data and personal information. You run your business, service your customers, protect your customers’ data, report & pay taxes, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations. Stripe may offer other services to you that may be subject to additional or different terms. <a href="#section_a" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Registering for Stripe

You provide us with basic information about your company; we will seek to verify your information (we may work with third parties to do so) and approve your account unless deemed risky (by us or our payment processors). You give us permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information or we otherwise must decline to offer Stripe Services to you. There are some prohibited activities for which you may not use the Stripe Services.  <a href="#section_b" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Receiving your Funds from Card Transactions

Funds from your transactions (minus our fees) are paid to you at a schedule communicated to you once your Stripe Account is approved. Initial payouts for your card transactions are typically sent to your bank within 7 days. A certain amount of your funds may be subject to an additional hold period (e.g. Reserve Account) with terms determined by your perceived risk and transaction history. You are responsible for refunds, returns, and liable for customer disputes (chargebacks). <a href="#section_c" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Termination and Other Legal Terms

We can terminate this agreement at any time (especially if you do something bad). You can also terminate anytime. Termination is effective immediately. Termination does not alter your liability for processed payments or related chargebacks. This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment). [Complete details](#section_d)

# Stripe Terms of Service

The Terms and Conditions described here constitute a legal agreement (“Agreement”) between the sole proprietor or business organization listed as the “Merchant” on the service registration page (sometimes referred to as “you,” “your”, “user”), Stripe, Inc. (“Stripe”), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”, collectively with Stripe referred as “we”, “our” or “us”).

#<a id="section_a"></a>Section A: Stripe Services

## 1. Our Role

Stripe Payments helps you accept and process credit card, debit card and other types of payments (collectively “Cards”) from your customers who want to pay you for products or services or give donations. Stripe’s card processing service supports US-issued card and most non-US issued cards with a Visa, MasterCard, Discover, JCB, or American Express logo (collectively “the Card Networks”) including credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards. Stripe is not a bank or a money services business (“MSB”) and Stripe does not offer banking or MSB services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. In addition, we do not assume any liability for the products or services purchased using Stripe Payments. You will be required to register with Stripe to use Stripe Payments (see [Registering for Stripe](#section_b)).

[Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/us/terms#stripe-connect) enables you to work with various platform providers to help manage your account, provide ancillary services, or perform analytics using your data from your Stripe account.  [Stripe Relay](https://stripe.com/us/terms#stripe-orders) provides you a mechanism for easily publishing your product data to various online channels. Each of these is discussed in more detail below.  Collectively, we refer to Stripe Payments, Stripe Connect, and Stripe Relay as the “Stripe Services.”

## 2. Stripe Payments

We provide an API and other software to enable you to use Stripe Payments. We reserve the right to require you install or update any and all software updates to continue using Stripe Payments. Stripe Payments also includes software to help you manage recurring and subscription billing charges for your products and services. It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent to be billed on a recurring basis in compliance with applicable legal requirements and Card Network payment rules.

## 3. Authorization for Handling of Funds

By accepting this agreement, you authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf when such funds from your card transactions settle from the Card Networks. You further authorize Stripe to instruct Wells Fargo on how your card transaction settlement funds should be disbursed to you (such as by ACH credit transaction or sending you a paper check payable to you) and the timing of such disbursements. Settlement funds will be held in a deposit account at Wells Fargo pending disbursement of the funds to you in accordance with the terms of this contract. You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement funds held by Wells Fargo pending settlement to your designated bank settlement account, that you have no right to direct that deposit account, and that you may not assign any interest in the deposit account at Wells Fargo. We may periodically make available to you information in the Stripe management dashboard regarding anticipated settlement amounts received on your behalf from the Card Networks and are being held pending settlement. This settlement information does not constitute a deposit or other obligation of Stripe or Wells Fargo to you. This settlement information reflected in the Stripe management dashboard is for reporting and informational purposes only, and you are not entitled to, and have no ownership or other rights in settlement funds, until such funds are credited to your designated bank settlement account. Your authorizations set forth herein will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe Account is closed or terminated.

## 4. Payment Methods

You may only process payments when authorized to do so by your customer. Stripe will only process transactions that have been authorized by the applicable Card Network or card issuer.

You are solely responsible for verifying identity of your customers, ensuring that they have authorized the transaction, and determining their eligibility to purchase your products and services. Stripe does not guarantee or assume any liability for transactions authorized and completed that are later reversed or charged back (see Chargebacks below). You are solely responsible for all reversed or charged back transactions, regardless of the reason for, or timing of, the reversal or chargeback. Stripe may add or remove one or more payment types or networks at any time.  If we do so we will use reasonable efforts to give you prior notice of the removal.

## 5. Customer Service

We will provide you with customer service to resolve issues relating to your Stripe Account, use of the Stripe Services, and the distribution of funds to your designated bank settlement account. You, and you alone, are responsible for providing service to your customers for any and all issues related to your products and services, including but not limited to issues arising from the processing of customers’ cards through Stripe Payments.

## 6. Taxes

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of your products and services and/or the payments you receive in connection with your use of Stripe Services (“Taxes”). It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct tax to the proper tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process and merchants to which we provide card payment services.

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations are required to file an information return with the IRS for each calendar year, reporting all payment card transactions and third-party network transactions with merchants occurring in that calendar year. You acknowledge that we will report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of the payments you receive each calendar year as required by law.

## 7. Your Data Security Obligations

You are fully responsible for the security of data on your site, through your app, or otherwise in your possession. You agree to comply with all applicable state and federal laws and rules in connection with your collection, security and dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or transaction information (defined as “Payment Data”) on your site or through your app. While Stripe helps to make compliance easier, you are solely responsible for compliance with any laws, regulations, or rules applicable to your business. You specifically agree that at all times you will be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) and the Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS), as applicable. The steps you will need to take to comply with PCI-DSS and PA-DSS when using Stripe will vary based on your implementation. For more information about implementing Stripe, please refer to our documentation. If we believe it is necessary based on your implementation and request it of you, you will promptly provide us with documentation evidencing your compliance with PCI DSS and/or PA DSS if requested by us. You also agree that you will use only PCI compliant service providers in connection with the storage, or transmission of Payment Data defined as a cardholder’s account number, expiration date, and CVV2. You must not store CVV2 data at any time. Information on the PCI DSS can be found on the [PCI Council’s website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org). It is your responsibility to comply with these standards.

## 8. Security and Fraud Controls

Stripe is responsible for protecting the security of Payment Data in our possession and will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect all the personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored in our servers from unauthorized access and accidental loss or modification. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide this personal information regarding you and your customers at your own risk. We recommend you review our [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy), which will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us.

Stripe may provide or suggest security procedures and controls intended to reduce the risk to you of fraud ("Security Controls").  These Security Controls may include processes or applications that are developed by Stripe or by third parties, including but not limited to providing two-factor authentication for logging into your Stripe Account. You agree to review all Security Controls and choose those that are appropriate for your business to protect against unauthorized transactions and, if necessary, use other procedures and controls not provided by us. Disabling or failing to properly use Security Controls increases your exposure to unauthorized Card transactions. Keep in mind that you are responsible for the use of lost or stolen data that is used to purchase products or services from your business.  We are not liable for and do not insure against losses to you or your customers resulting from use of lost or stolen data with Stripe Payments (including but not limited to losses arising from the use of lost or stolen credit cards to make purchases from your site or app, or those caused by a compromise of your login credentials).

## 9. Audit Right

If we believe that a security breach or compromise of data has occurred, we may require you to have a third-party auditor that is approved by us conduct a security audit of your systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to us, our banking partners, and the Card Networks.

## 10. Your Privacy

Privacy and the protection of personal information are very important to us. You acknowledge that you have received, read in full, and agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy, linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which contains your consent to our collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal information as well as other matters.  The [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) also explains how and for what purposes we collect, use, retain, disclose, and safeguard the personal information provided to us. You acknowledge that we are required to provide your business name and limited information to financial services providers as part of Stripe Payments.  In the event of a default under this Agreement or a misuse of applicable financial networks, we may also report your business name and the name of your principals to the MATCHTM listing maintained by MasterCard and accessed and updated by Visa and American Express or to the Consortium Merchant Negative File maintained by Discover, if applicable, pursuant to the requirements of the Network Rules (as defined below, in Section 14). You specifically consent to the fulfillment of the obligations related to the listing by us or our payment processor and to the listing itself and you waive and hold harmless us or our payment processor from all claims and liabilities you may have as a result of such reporting.

## 11. Privacy of Others

You represent to Stripe that you are and will continue to be in compliance with all applicable privacy laws. You further represent that you have obtained all necessary rights and consents under applicable law to disclose to Stripe – or allow Stripe to collect, use, retain, and disclose – any data that you provide to us or authorize us to collect, including information that we may collect directly from your end users via cookies or other means. As between you and Stripe, you are solely responsible for disclosing to your customers, as applicable, that you are utilizing Stripe Services and providing customer data to Stripe.

If you receive information about others, including cardholders, through the use of the Stripe Services, you must keep such information confidential and may only use it in connection with the Stripe Services. You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a third party or use any such information for marketing purposes unless you receive the express consent of the user to do so. You may not disclose card information to any third party, other than in connection with processing a card transaction requested by your customer using Stripe Payments and in a manner consistent with PCI DSS and applicable law.

## 12. Restricted Use

You are required to obey all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Stripe Services (for example, those governing financial services, consumer protections, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, or false advertising). In addition to any other requirements or restrictions set forth in this Agreement, you will not use Stripe Payments to: (i) utilize the credit available on any Card to provide cash advances to cardholders; (ii) submit any transaction for processing that does not arise from your sale of products or services to a buyer customer, or acceptance of a bona fide charitable donation; (iii) act as a payment intermediary or aggregator or otherwise resell our services on behalf of any third party; (iv) send what you believe to be potentially fraudulent authorizations or fraudulent transaction; or (v) use Stripe in a manner that Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, or any other Card Network or payment network might reasonably believe to be an abuse of such network or a violation of its applicable rules.

You further agree not to, nor to permit any third party to, do any of the following with the Stripe Services: (i) access or attempt to access Stripe systems, programs, or data that are not made available for public use; (ii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell, or distribute in any way material from Stripe, Stripe’s website, or Stripe Services; (iii) permit any third party to use Stripe Services via a rental, lease, timesharing, service bureau, or other arrangement; (iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (v) work around any of the technical limitations, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled – or decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer – except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (vi) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the normal operation, or prevent access to or use by our other users, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; or (vii) use in a manner that is not expressly permitted in this Agreement.

## 13. Suspicion of Unauthorized or Illegal Use

We reserve the right to not authorize or settle any transaction you submit which we believe is in violation of this Agreement, any other Stripe agreement, or exposes you, other Stripe users, financial services providers, or Stripe to harm or unnecessary risk, including but not limited to fraud and other criminal acts. You grant us authorization to share information with law enforcement about you, your transactions, or your Stripe Account if we reasonably suspect that your use of Stripe has been for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose.

## 14. Card Network Rules

The Card Networks have established guidelines, bylaws, rules, and regulations (“Network Rules”). You are required to comply with all applicable Network Rules that are applicable to merchants. You can review portions of the Network Rules at [Visa](http://usa.visa.com/merchants/operations/op_regulations.html), [MasterCard](http://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/support/rules.html), and [American Express](https://www209.americanexpress.com/merchant/services/en_US/merchant-regulations). The Card Networks reserve the right to amend the Network Rules. Stripe reserves the right to amend the Agreement at any time with notice to you as necessary to comply with Network Rules or otherwise address changes to the Stripe Services.

## 15. Disclosures and Notices

You agree that Stripe can provide disclosures and notices regarding the Stripe Services to you by posting such disclosures and notices through the Stripe management dashboard, emailing them to the email address listed in your Stripe Account, mailing them to the address listed in your Stripe Account, or posting them to our website. You also agree that electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with a paper copy. Such disclosures and notices will be considered to be received by you within 24 hours of the time it is posted to our website or emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered.

## 16. References to Our Relationship

You agree that, from the time you begin processing payment with Stripe until you terminate your account with us, we may identify you as a customer of Stripe.   Neither you nor we will imply any untrue sponsorship, endorsement or affiliation between you and Stripe.

## 17. Stripe Connect

Stripe Connect allows third-party platform providers (“Platforms”) to help you administer your Stripe Account and provide additional services directly to you or your customers.  To permit Platforms to connect to your Stripe Account, you must add the Platform through the Stripe management dashboard and accept the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms) (“Stripe Connected Account Agreement”).

By connecting Platforms to your Stripe Account you are authorizing Stripe to permit these Platforms to (a) access your Stripe Account and Payment Data, (b) create charges and customers in your Stripe Account, and (c) deduct amounts (for example, fees and charges) from the amount that would otherwise be payable to you from transactions occurring in connection with the Platform (“Platform Fees”).  Any Platform Fees will be separately agreed upon by you and the Platform, and will be in addition to Stripe’s fees and charges.

Once you have authorized a Platform it will continue to have access to your Stripe Account and be authorized as described in Stripe Connected Account Agreement until you specifically withdraw your authorization by changing the settings through your [Stripe management dashboard]( https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications).

## 18. Stripe Relay

Stripe Relay allows you to publish information that describes specific products or services and their variations, including but not limited to descriptions, SKUs, prices, inventory, and images (“Product Data”) to various online, mobile, off-site online or affiliate channels (each a “Channel”); allows customers to make purchases of such products through such Channels (each an “Order”); and permits you to manage inventory and order information for such purchases.  As used in this section, “Order Data” means the information transmitted using your systems, or systems you control, for the purpose of initiating or completing a transaction (including portions of the Payment Data).

Any Product Data you provide to us will be provided to the Channels you select through the Stripe management dashboard.  You understand and agree that Channels will publish Product Data as you have provided it through Stripe Relay. You are solely responsible for acquiring the appropriate rights to publish Product Information through the Channels, and for any pricing, inventory information, facts or statements – even those made erroneously – that are contained in the Product Data. You grant to Stripe a worldwide, fully-paid, nontransferable license to: (a) publish Product Data through the Channels, (b) receive and transmit Order Data to you, and (c) use any trademarks, service marks, or non-public personal information contained in Product Data or Orders data therein to the extent required to perform either (a) or (b); and authorize Stripe to sublicense such rights to Channels.  You agree to hold Channels harmless for claims or losses you incur due to the use of Order Data or publication of Product Data to facilitate your use of Stripe Relay.

You may only use Stripe Relay to publish Product Data to Channels, and may only receive and transmit Order Data between Channels and your systems (or systems under your control) for your own benefit. You may not resell or distribute Stripe Relay to third parties.

You represent and warrant that you will not falsely advertise any Product Data through Channels, and that you will not use any unfair or deceptive acts or practices when advertising the underlying product or service through the Channels.  You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for production, fulfillment, shipping, or providing any ancillary services related to Orders you receive through your use of Stripe Relay.

## 19. Additional Services

From time to time we may offer you additional features or services (“Additional Services”), such as [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout/info) or international services, which may be subject to additional or different terms of service.  As with the Stripe Services, you may not use these Additional Services unless you agree to the applicable terms of service.  Except where expressly stated otherwise, your use of Additional Services will have no impact on the applicability of this Agreement to the Service.

#<a id="section_b"></a>Section B: Registering your Stripe Account

## 1. Registration

The Stripe Services are only made available under this Agreement to persons in the United States that operate a business selling products or services, or to accept donations for a bona fide charitable organization. Stripe Payments may not be used to accept payments for personal, family, or household purposes. To use the Stripe Services, you will first have to register. When you register, we will collect basic information including your name, company name, location, email address, tax identification number, and phone number. If you have not already done so, you will also be required to provide an email address and password for your Stripe Account. You may not register another account with Stripe if we have already rejected an account for your business.  If you believe your original application was rejected in error, please contact our [Support team](https://support.stripe.com/email/login) to review your account.

You may choose to register as an individual (sole proprietor) or as a business organization. If you register as a business organization, you must also provide information about an owner or principal of the business and you must be authorized to act on behalf of the business, and must have the authority to bind the business to this Agreement. Keep in mind that you are accepting the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of the business. If you are a sole proprietor, the term “you” will mean you, the natural person, as well as the business organization that you represent.

## 2. Company Descriptions and URL

As part of your registration, you must provide the URL for your business and the name under which you do business, which may be the business’s legal name or a DBA. These two fields may appear in your customers’ credit or debit card statements. To avoid customer confusion and transaction disputes, you must enter a description that clearly identifies your business as well as an accurate URL.

## 3. Verification and Underwriting

To verify your identity, we will require additional information including your business EIN or Tax ID, social security number, and date of birth. We may also ask for additional information to help verify your identity and assess your business risk including business invoices, a driver’s license or other government issued identification, or a business license. We may ask you for financial statements. We may request for your permission to do a physical inspection at your place of business and to examine books and records that pertain to your compliance with this Agreement. Your failure to comply with any of these requests within five (5) days may result in suspension or termination of your Stripe Account.

Stripe may use your information to apply for card merchant acquiring accounts on your behalf with certain Networks (such as American Express), and you hereby authorize us to do so. If we or American Express request that you do so, you will also be required to enter into a direct agreement with American Express in addition to this Agreement. In that case, unless you expressly inform us in writing otherwise, you hereby authorize Stripe to continue to manage your American Express account on your behalf and to cause funds settled from American Express transactions to be deposited to an omnibus bank account designated by Stripe for your benefit.

After we have collected and verified all your information, Stripe will review your account and determine if you are eligible to use the Stripe Services. Stripe may also share your information with our payment processors (such as Wells Fargo), each of which may also make a determination regarding your eligibility. We will notify you once your account has been either approved or deemed ineligible for use of the Stripe Services.

By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you authorize us to retrieve information about you by using third parties, including credit bureaus and other information providers. You acknowledge that such information retrieved may include your name, address history, credit history, and other data about you. Stripe may periodically update this information to determine whether you continue to meet our eligibility requirements.

You agree that Stripe is permitted to contact and share information about you and your application (including whether you are approved or declined), and your use of Stripe with the financial services providers we work with, including Wells Fargo. This includes sharing information (a) about your transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes, (b) for use in connection with the management and maintenance of the program, (c) to create and update their customer records about you and to assist them in better serving you, and (d) to conduct Stripe’s risk management process.

## 4. The Stripe Services - US only

By registering for Stripe, you confirm that you are either a legal resident of the United States, a United States citizen, or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the state in which you operate. Stripe may only be used to process payment for businesses in the fifty states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia. Except where expressly permitted, you may not export the Stripe Services directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Stripe Services may be subject to export restrictions imposed by US law, including US Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. Chapter VII).

By accepting this Agreement you confirm that you will satisfy these requirements.

## 5. Prohibited Businesses

There are certain categories of businesses and business practices for which the Stripe Services cannot be used (“Prohibited Businesses”).   Many of these Prohibited Business categories are imposed by Card Network rules or the requirements of our banking providers or processors.  We maintain a list here: [Prohibited Businesses](https://stripe.com/prohibited_businesses).  By registering a Stripe Account, you confirm that you will not use the Stripe Services in connection with any of the Prohibited Businesses.  If you are uncertain as to whether a business is a Prohibited Business, or have questions about how these requirements apply to your business, please contact us.

#<a id="section_c"></a>Section C: Processing Card Transactions, Receiving Your Funds, and Fees

## 1. Processing Card Transactions

As used in this Agreement, a “Chargeback” is a request that you customer files directly with an issuing bank to reverse or invalidate a processed payment, and a “Refund” means a reversal of a charge, in whole or in part, that you initiate. “Claim” means a challenge to a payment that you or a buyer customer files directly with Stripe. “Reversal” means Stripe reverses the settlement of funds from a processed card transaction that you received because (a) the card transaction is invalidated by the card issuer for any reason, (b) the settlement funds were sent to you in error for any reason, (c) the sender of the payment did not have authorization to send the payment (for example, the purchaser used a card that did not belong to him or her), (d) you received the payment for activities that violated this Agreement or any other agreement you have with Stripe, or (e) we decided a Claim against you.

You agree that you will honor all eligible cards presented for payment by your customers for your products and services in accordance with the Network Rules, this Agreement and any operating guides that we may provide you from time to time. You agree that you will obtain an authorization for each card transaction, as required under the Network Rules, and will not submit a card transaction for settlement where you know there is a negative authorization or the card is otherwise expired or invalid. You acknowledge that the existence of an affirmative authorization from us or the Card Networks does not mean that a particular card transaction won’t result in a Chargeback, Reversal or Claim at some later date.

While you may charge fees for your products or services, you may not impose any fee or surcharge for payment processing on a customer that seeks to use an eligible payment card or misrepresent fees charged for payment processing. You will provide a receipt to the customer at the conclusion of the purchase transaction that includes all information required under Card Network rules and applicable law.

You will submit all card transactions for processing no later than 3 days from the date of authorization. You will maintain appropriate records of all payment transactions for a period of at least 2 years from the date of the transaction.

You will display all Card Network marks in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Card Networks, and will use such marks only to indicate that you accept their cards for payment.

We may offer you the ability to have funds settled to your bank account in a currency different from the one in which you accepted payment from a customer (“Multi-Currency Processing”). To use this service, you must provide us with a valid bank account for each currency for which you request settlement, based on our list of available settlement currencies. We may add or remove currencies from our list of available settlement currencies at any time. If you use Multi-Currency Processing, we will identify at the time of charge (through an API response) the conversion rate that will apply to the charge.  If you Refund a charge, the conversion rate that will apply will be the rate in effect at the time of the Refund, not the charge.  By submitting a charge or refund for processing you will be deemed to have accepted the rate. You may choose not to use the Multi-Currency Processing service at any time. You may change the bank account information or other settings associated with your use of Multi-Currency Processing, but any such changes will only affect subsequent charges.

## 2. Payouts and Transaction History

We will pay out funds settling from the Card Networks to your designated bank or card settlement account (“Bank Account”) you provide when registering your Stripe Account. Funds will be settled in the Bank Account in the amounts actually received (less our Fees, as defined below) for transactions processed by Stripe Payments. Your Bank Account must be located at bank branch in the United States and held in the name of your business. You are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding your Bank Account, including inputting the correct information as part of registering or updating your Bank Account. Funds for transactions may be transferred to your Bank Account prior to funds being settled from the Card Networks. Any such funds paid to you prior to having been settled are considered preliminarily credited but may be Reversed if the transaction does not ultimately clear the Card Network.  The actual timing of the transfers to your Bank Account of the settling funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule (as defined below).

After transfer of funds is initiated to your Bank Account, we will update information in your Stripe Account to reflect settlement. Information regarding your transactions that are processed and settled using Stripe Payments (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when you login to your Stripe Account. While will provide Transaction History in your Stripe Account, you are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Stripe Account as may be required for your business.. Stripe is not responsible for maintaining Transaction History or other records in a manner consistent with your record retention obligations and may change the duration of the Transaction History at any time, but will always maintain the previous 18 months’ transactions.

## 3. Payout Schedule

“Payout Schedule” refers to the time it takes for us to initiate a transfer to your designated Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through Stripe Payments. Once your Bank Account information has been reviewed, Stripe will initiate transfer of settlement funds (net of Fees, Chargebacks, and other funds owed to us for any reason) in accordance with the Payout Schedule, the terms of which will be made available to you when you login to your Stripe management dashboard. The settlement funds should normally be credited to your Bank Account within 1-2 days of us initiating the payout. The initial transfer to your account may be delayed pending review of your account. We are not responsible for any action taken by the financial institution holding your Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to your Bank Account or not being made available to you. You can contact us at any time to inquire about changing the timing of your Payout Schedule, and will be informed of the process and requirements for Stripe to review your Payout Schedule.

We reserve the right to change the Payout Schedule, suspend payouts to your Bank Account, or initiate a Reversal should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or Refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with your use of Stripe Payments, or if required by law or court order.

## 4. Reconciliations and Errors

Transaction History will be available to you when you login to the Stripe management dashboard. You are responsible for reconciling your Transaction History with your actual transactions, and agree to notify us of any errors or discrepancies in your Transaction History (each an “Error”) arising from such reconciliation and verification. We will investigate reported Errors and attempt to rectify any Errors that you or we discover. In the event you are owed money as a result of an Error, we will transfer funds to your Bank Account in the next scheduled payout. While we may still work with you to reconcile Errors, your failure to notify us such Errors within 60 days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts that may be owed to you in connection with any such Error, including any related charges.

If you submit or cause us to process transactions erroneously, you will contact us immediately. We will investigate any reported erroneous transactions and attempt to rectify them by crediting or debiting your Bank Account as appropriate. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within 30 days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

## 5. Refunds and Returns

You agree to submit all Refunds for returns of your products and services that you used Stripe Payments to receive payment through Stripe Payments to your customers in accordance with this Agreement and Network Rules. Network Rules require that you will (i) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (ii) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase; (iii) not give cash Refunds to a customer in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law; and (iv) not accept cash or any other item of value for a Refund.

Full Refunds must be for the exact dollar amount of the original transaction including tax, handling charges, and other. The Refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to customer for postage costs incurred for product returns. You will use best efforts to process all Refunds within 60 days after the original transaction date, and you acknowledge that Refunds processed after that time may not be capable of being processed.

Stripe will deduct the Refund amount (including any applicable Fees) from (i) settlement funds owed to you from processing of other card transactions, or (ii) funds in any Reserve Account. Where these funds are not sufficient, you authorize Stripe to initiate a debit entry to your Bank Account in the amount necessary to complete the refund transaction to the cardholder’s card. In the event Stripe cannot debit your Bank Account, you agree to pay all funds owed to Stripe immediately upon demand. You are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services. We have no responsibility or obligation for processing such returns, or for responding to your customers’ inquiries about such returns.

## 6. Chargebacks

A Chargeback is typically caused when a customer disputes a charge that appears on their bill. A Chargeback may result in the reversal of a transaction where you are immediately liable for the amount of the transaction. You can be assessed Chargebacks for (i) customer disputes; (ii) unauthorized or improperly authorized transactions; (iii) transactions that do not comply with Network Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious; or (iv) any reversals for any reason by the Card Network, our processor, or the acquiring or issuing banks.

When a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable to Stripe for the full amount of the transaction related to the Chargeback plus any associated Fees, fines, expenses or penalties (including those assessed by the Card Networks or our payment processors). You agree that Stripe may recover these amounts by debiting your Bank Account, debiting the Reserve Account, or setting off any amounts owed to you by us. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. Where such amounts are not immediately paid to us, you agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of any unpaid Chargebacks unpaid by you.

If we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.

## 7. Contesting your Chargebacks

You or Stripe may elect to contest Chargebacks assessed against you. Stripe may provide you with assistance including notifications and support to help contest your Chargebacks, but we do not assume any liability for our role or assistance in contesting Chargebacks.

You agree to provide us with the necessary information, in a timely manner and at your expense, to investigate or help resolve any Chargeback. You also grant us permission to share records or other information required with financial institutions and Card Networks to help resolve any disputes. You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result in an irreversible Chargeback being assessed.

If the Chargeback is not resolved in your favor, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees from you. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating or investigating Chargeback disputes.

## 8. Excessive Chargebacks

At any point, Stripe, Wells Fargo, the Card Networks, or our payment processors may determine that you are incurring excessive Chargebacks. Card Networks typically consider Chargeback volume approaching 1% of your total processing volume to be excessive, although the level at which you are considered to have excessive Chargebacks may be more or less than that.  Excessive Chargebacks may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines. Excessive Chargebacks may also result in (a) additional controls and restrictions put on your use of Stripe Payments, including without limitation, (i) changes to the terms of your Reserve Account, (ii) increases to your applicable Fees, or (iii) delays in your Payout Schedule; or (b) possible suspension or termination of your Stripe Account and access to the Stripe Services. The Card Networks may also place additional controls or restrictions as part of their own monitoring programs for merchants with excessive Chargebacks.

## 9. Stripe Fees

You agree to pay all fees assessed by us to you for providing the Stripe Services described in this Agreement (“Fees”). Except as otherwise stated in writing by Stripe, these fees will be calculated pursuant to the [Fee Schedule](https://stripe.com/help/pricing) linked to here and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. We reserve the right to revise our Fees with 30 days’ notice to you.

You acknowledge that you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed on Stripe or you by any Card Network or financial institution as a result of your use of the Stripe Services.

## 10. Our Collection Rights

To the extent permitted by law, we may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by deducting the corresponding amounts from the Reserve Account or from funds payable to you arising from the settlement of card transactions, including funds from another one or your Stripe Accounts. Fees will be assessed at the time a transaction is processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for such transactions. If the settlement amounts or Reserve Account are not sufficient to meet your obligations to us, we may debit the Bank Account registered in your Stripe Accounts for any amounts owed to us. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand is a material breach of this Agreement and you will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.

In some cases, we may require a personal guarantee from a principal from your business as a condition of our continuing to provide Stripe Services to you. If a personal guarantee is necessary, we will specifically inform you in advance.

## 11. Reserves

In certain circumstances, we may determine that a Reserve Account is necessary to provide the Stripe Services to you.  Where needed, Stripe may, in its sole discretion, set the terms of your Reserve Account and notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for your transaction is held for a period of time or that additional amounts are held in a Reserve Account. Stripe, in its sole discretion, may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any time for any reason based on your payment processing history or as requested by our payment processors.

Stripe may fund the Reserve Account through (i) funds owed to you for transactions submitted through the Stripe Service , (ii) debiting your Bank Account, (iii) through other sources associated with your Stripe Account, or (iv) requesting that you provide funds to Stripe for deposit.

## 12. Security Interest

You grant us a lien and security interest in the Reserve Account, all transactions (including future transactions), any rights to receive credits or payments under this Agreement, and all deposits and other property of yours possessed or maintained by us on your behalf. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest, even if such request is made after you have established a negative balance with Stripe.
