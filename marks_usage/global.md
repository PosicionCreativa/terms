<section>
You may use the Stripe name and logo (“Stripe Marks”) to let your customers know that Stripe (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides payment processing services for your business.

The Stripe Marks are important assets of Stripe’s business, and they are protected by US and international copyright and trademark laws. By using them you agree as follows:

*  We grant you permission to use the Stripe Marks on a non-exclusive, non-transferable basis. This permission may be revoked at any time at our discretion. Of course, we don’t expect to do this without a good reason.

*  You may only use the Stripe Marks on that portion of your website or application that directly relates to payment processing services that we provide you. You won’t imply any relationship with Stripe other than the one that actually exists.

*  Stripe may provide you with style or usage guidelines from time to time, including such things as size, color or placement. Unless we agree otherwise, you will use the Stripe Marks only in a way that is consistent with those guidelines. You will update your use of the Stripe Marks to conform to changes in the guidelines within a reasonable time after we provide you notice of the change.

*  You may not use the Stripe Marks or the word "Stripe", any confusingly similar name or trademark, in the name of your product or service, or in your domain name, without our prior written approval.

*  You will not display, copy, modify or transmit the Stripe Marks in any way except as described in this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by Stripe, Inc.
